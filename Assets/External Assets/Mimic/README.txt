Sorry for the messy code this was just a prototype but
i decided to share it because a lot of people asked for it

The Shaders are made for URP but you can just just any
material you want


[How to use]

-Just drag and drop the Prefab "Mimic" into a scene make
it requires collidersbelow to work

-There is a VERY basic movement script, if you replace it
don't forget to update the Mimic's "velocity" variable
this is required to properly place the legs in front while it
is moving

-To use the mesh version, just swap the legPrefab variable
by the type of leg you want and assign the proper material
to the Mimic's body.

HAVE FUN :D
